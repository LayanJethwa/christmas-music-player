This is a Christmas website I made, that plays Christmas music to you!  
It is written using pure (vanilla) HTML, CSS and JS.  
You can access it at:  

There is also a helper Python script, which reads metadata from the audio files provided, and then stores it in a text file so that the JavaScript can read it in easily.  


If you would like to add your own music, you can clone the repo, then upload any mp3 file to the christmas-music folder. Run the Python file to regenerate the data files, then you can run the website as normal.  
If you want to add a different folder, you can upload all the music in a folder to the root directory after cloning. You then update the variables in the Python and JS to reflect the new folder name, run the Python file, and then run the website.  

Enjoy!
